# CS 260 Notes

[My startup - Simon](https://simon.cs260.click)

## Assignment 1

I learned a lot about Github and how to access the different features that it has and utilize them. I am excited to learn more about this and use it in this CS class. I learned how to access Git from the command line and also VS Code, which should be handy in the future to be able to push, pull and commit. I had to work through a couple things on my computer but it was pretty fun and interesting to figure out.

## HTML

It is important to have navigation links between the pages and to think like the user when designing the website structure. You want to always test the edge cases and desgin each piece and bit carefully and plan how to use each thing in the future.
