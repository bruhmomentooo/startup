# CS 260 Notes

[My startup - Simon](https://simon.cs260.click)

## Assignment 1

I learned a lot about Github and how to access the different features that it has and utilize them. I am excited to learn more about this and use it in this CS class. I learned how to access Git from the command line and also VS Code, which should be handy in the future to be able to push, pull and commit. I had to work through a couple things on my computer but it was pretty fun and interesting to figure out.
